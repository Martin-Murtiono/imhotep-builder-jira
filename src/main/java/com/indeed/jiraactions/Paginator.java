     * This is kind of complicated, and there's a write-up in JAI-5. But the basic idea is that we want to
     * process the entire run first. Then, we start over. But we only want to process until we get to the
     * point where everything is the same as we've already seen. When that happens, we stop.
     *
     * So imagine we see have 26 issues, A-Z. Issues A-Y fall into our time ranger, but Z is too old.
     * We process A, B, C, D, E.
     * We process F, G, H, I, J. At this point, issue Z is modified (and goes to the beginning of our search).
     * We process J, K, L, M, N. At this point, issue E is modified (and goes to the beginning of our search).
     * ...
     * Eventually we get to the end and process Y. At this point, issue A is modified (and goes to the beginning of our search).
     *
     * Then we want to reprocess A, E, Z, and then stop.
     *
     * Every time we process an issue, we remove it from our seenIssues map and re-add it (putting it at the
     * end). Consequently, we know we can stop when we see the first issue in our seenIssues map *and* it
     * has no new actions.
     *
     * There are three scenarios:
     * 1) We are just processing all the issues. Continue through to the end.
     * 2) We are doing a second pass, but we had to read through a bunch of issues until we get to the old beginning.
     *    Then we should bail out and start at the beginning again to just pick up what's new during this pass.
     * 3) We find something we've already seen at the very beginning of our list. We're done.
